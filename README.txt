Artifical vision project using OpenCV libraries. This is just the source code, so try clonning it in your local reporitory and copy the .cpp files in a new ones. The .txt file contained the parameters needed for the Webcam. From this repository you will only need the .txt and the main code, but of course you will need to have previously installed on your computer the OpenCV libraries. If you have this libraries, download the code with the data file and run it.

The following project consists on a Aruco detector. The camera detects the Aruco and draws a square on it. 
The system generally works well altough you must place correctly the Aruco just in front of the camera, otherwise the camera wonÂ´t detect the Aruco.
